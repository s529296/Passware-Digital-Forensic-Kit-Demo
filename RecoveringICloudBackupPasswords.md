Copy and paste all the passwords it found on your machine into a text file and save it somewhere you can find it.
NOTE: Make sure you delete this file at the conclusion of the demo if you have current passwords saved in the text file.

Now go to the home screen of the Passware software and click 
'Dictionary Manager' under tools. A known passwords dictionary is allowed in the full version, so we are going to make our own dictionary of known passwords using the ones we found in the above steps.
